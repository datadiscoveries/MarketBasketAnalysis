# Market Basket Analysis - Product Recommendation System for Digital Store

**Goal:**<br>
The goal of this analysis is to determine which products should be recommended to online shoppers of an e-commerce business, given the items that they have already added to their cart. This will be achieved by analyzing historic customer purchasing behavior and finding products with the highest probability of purchase, using the Apriori algorithm. Potential applications of the results will be recommended to boost sales and strengthen customer loyalty.<br>

**Findings:**<br>
The products below, on the right-hand side of the Y-axis, have the highest probability of purchase, given that the shopper has added the products on the left-hand side of the Y-axis to their cart.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>*On the y-axis, the products on the left-hand-side represent the shopper's cart. The product on the right-hand-side represents the product that should be recommended to the shopper.</sub>
<br>

**Recommendations:<br>**
1. Recommend the above products (right-hand side) to shoppers with associated shopping carts (left-hand side). Additionally, all products with a probability of purchase above a desired threshold should be recommended. Promoting these highly relevant recommendations is likely to improve the customer experience, heighten consumer trust, improve company reputation and branding, increase repeat purchases, strengthen the business' long-term sustainability, and generate sales that would have otherwise been lost.<br>
2. Since the above products are often purchased together, promote bundles at a discount, where each right-hand side product is bundled with its prespective left-hand-side group of products. The bundle strategy is likely to entice shoppers and boost sales while maintaining a healthy profit margin, due to increased efficiencies in shipping and operating costs.  
3. If a shopper did not purchase their recommended product, they may not have been in a position at that time to purchase. If they are subscribed to receive emails, send a promotion at a later time with a discounted price on the recommended product.

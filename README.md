# Market Basket Analysis - Product Recommendation System for Digital Store

**Goal:**<br>
The goal of this analysis is to determine which products should be recommended to online shoppers of an e-commerce business, given the items that they have already added to their cart. This will be achieved by analyzing historic customer purchasing behavior and finding products with the highest probability of purchase, using the Apriori algorithm. Potential applications of the results will be recommended to boost sales and strengthen customer loyalty.<br>

**Findings:**<br>
The products below, on the right-hand side of the Y-axis, have the highest probability of purchase, given that the shopper has added the products on the left-hand side of the Y-axis to their cart.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>*On the y-axis, items on the left represent cart items. Item on the right represent recommended items.</sub>
<br>

**Recommended Action:<br>**
1. Recommend the above products (right-hand side) to shoppers with associated shopping carts (left-hand side), as well as all products with a probability of purchase above a desired threshold. Promoting these highly relevant recommendations is likely to improve the customer experience, heighten consumer trust, improve company reputation and branding, increase repeat purchases, strengthen the business' long-term sustainability, and generate sales that would have otherwise been lost.<br>
2. Since the above products are often purchased together, promote bundles at a discount, where each right-hand side product is bundled with its prespective left-hand-side group of products. The bundle strategy is likely to entice shoppers and boost sales while maintaining a healthy profit margin, due to increased efficiencies in shipping and operating costs.  
3. If a shopper did not purchase their recommended product, they may not have been in a position to purchase at the time. If the shopper is subscribed to receive emails, send them a promotion at a later time with a discounted price on the recommended product.

**Additional Opportunities:<br>**
1. Compile additional data that allows for additional and more personalized product recommendations using clustering and customer profiling techniques. Other valuable features may include customer ID, additional product interactions (viewed, wishlisted, and favorited), customer demographics, additional purchase details (frequency, amounts, and recency), site behavior (time spent on certain pages, clickstream data, search queries, and navigation patterns), social media activity, customer feedback and reviews, personal preferences and interests listed in the store, and contextual factors (time of year, seasonal trends, cultural events, and geographic factors)<br>
2. Sales trends should be monitored and compared with differening recommendation models and strategies to find a combination that returns optimal customer engagement, customer loyalty, and sales.
